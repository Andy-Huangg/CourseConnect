# Course Connect

## Introduction

Course Connect is a full‑stack web application that lets university students communicate in real time. Users can join course‑specific chatrooms to discuss topics anonymously and opt into a **Study Buddy** feature for private one‑on‑one collaboration.

## Relation to the Networking Theme

By enabling real‑time course chat and anonymous peer pairing, Course Connect directly supports the **Networking** theme, helping students build connections, share knowledge, and form study partnerships in a low‑barrier environment.

## Unique Features

- **Study Buddy Matching**  
  One private, anonymous pairing per course for focused collaboration.
- **Anonymous Chat**  
  Public course rooms where identities can be hidden, encouraging open discussion.

## Advanced Features

The following three advanced features are to be marked for assessment:

- [x] **WebSockets** — Real‑time bidirectional communication for chat and study buddy updates
- [x] **End‑to‑End Testing with Cypress** — Automated tests covering core user flows
- [x] **Theme Switching** — Full light/dark mode support across the UI

### Other Advanced Features

These additional features showcase extra effort (not marked):

- **Redux** for centralized state management
- **Dockerization** of both frontend and backend for consistent environments
